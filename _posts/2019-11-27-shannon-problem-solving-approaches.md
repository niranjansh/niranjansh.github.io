In their biography of Claude Shannon titled *A Mind at Play*, authors Jimmy Soni and Rob Goodman cite the following 6 strategies for solving a problem based on a talk Shannon gave at Bell Labs. Quotes are from Shannon.  

\\
1\. **Simplify the problem**

>"Almost every problem that you come across is befuddled with all kinds of extraneous data of one sort or another; and if you can bring the problem down into the main issues, you can see more clearly what you're trying to do."  

\\
2\. **Solve via similarities**
\\
\\
Find similar questions with answers, and deduce common patterns in the answers, and this in turn may lead you to the answer to your problem
\\
\\
3\. **Restate the question**

>"Change the viewpoint. Break loose from certain mental blocks which are holding you in certain ways of looking at a problem"

\\
4\. **Structural analysis of the problem**
\\
\\
Break a problem into small pieces. 
>"Many proofs in mathematics have been found by an extremely roundabout process. A man starts to prove his theorem and he finds that he wanders all over the map. He starts off and proves a good many results which don't seem to be leading anywhere and then eventually ends up by the back door on the solution of the given problem."

\\
5\. **Inversion**
\\
\\
If you can't use your premise to prove the conclusion, imagine the conclusion is already true, and try proving the premise instead. 
\\
\\
6\. **Generalize**
\\
\\
Once you have proved a special case, start generalizing it.
