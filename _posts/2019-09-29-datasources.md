Below are a few free-to-use data resources that I have found to be useful. 

### [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)

The UC Irvine ML repository is one of the oldest resources for data, having been around since 1987, and continues to be updated with new datasets. 


### [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/)

Quandl allows you to search both free and premium datasets, along with packages for Python and R that allow for easy acccess to the data from within your scripts. 

### [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

The popular data science competition platform, Kaggle, has since early 2017 been hosting datasets that now number over 10,000. You can also find links from each dataset to kernels - R and Python notebooks - that Kaggle users have created to analyze and build models on the data. 

### [Data World](https://data.world/)

Data World requires a log-in to view and access the data. Once you log-in, you can view, bookmark, query, and download the well formatted datasets. 

### [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch)

[Launched in September 2018](https://www.blog.google/products/search/making-it-easier-discover-datasets/), Google Dataset Search is like Google search but for data. Google also has a [public data explorer](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory) though the collection there is limited.
