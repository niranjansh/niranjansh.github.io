I will, therefore, resist the temptation to blame poor website templates for my lack of consistent writing. Nor do I believe that this recent experiment at one more template will spur a fountain of well-formed ideas that manifest themselves as well written posts. One has to keep trying, though.\n\nMy motivation has been the latest release of a new version of \n\nJupyter Book. I have been using it as a personal knowledgebase for some time now. Not since I came across \n\nBookdown back during my time of using R have I been this excited about creating documents. Having cycled through multiple Jekyll and Pelikan templates over the years, this feels like the closest thing to what I had in the mind for a personal website where I can post from time to time. I like that it supports Jupyter notebooks, which is where I get much of my work done. It is not perfect, but neither am I.\n\nIt is with much enthusiasm that I embark on this new journey, or rather a familiar journey in a new terrain.
