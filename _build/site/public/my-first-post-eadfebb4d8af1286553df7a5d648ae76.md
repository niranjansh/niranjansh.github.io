I have been using Jupyter Books v1 as a personal knowledgebase for some time now. With the release of v2, the interface has become much cleaner where I feel like I might be able to use it as a blog. So here it is. 

This is the content of my blog post, written in MyST Markdown.

You can include **code blocks** and **outputs** just like in a normal Jupyter Book!
